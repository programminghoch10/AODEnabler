# AODEnabler
This is a simple module adding some configs to enable Always on Display for all devices.

But beware: 
Devices not ready for AOD will keep the display on and have high power consumption.
Use at your own risk!

With the module active, you may control AOD in your system settings.
This may or may not be in `Settings -> Display -> Lockscreen`
